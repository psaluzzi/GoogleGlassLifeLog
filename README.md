GoogleGlassLifeLog
==================

LifeTrack on Glass UI
The object of this application is to create and track daily moments of your life as they happen and have the capacity to catalog them for future reference. this app is ideal for pregnancies weddings college years high school years etc.
 
The App would first function in the Google glass user-interface it would have to be downloaded from the glass store and placed onto the glass firmware. the client would have to open up the app By tapping through the side of glass or by saying "okay glass " open it's a wonderful life lifelog app. 
Also a Google play and a iOS app will be deployed on a phone or tablet. The app will allow the user to create settings and track activity throughout the life logging process
 
Step one in the app is to create a user interface that is very fluid and simple for an average user. the user will be able to determine how often do the glasses take a picture of their life every half hour once an hour etc. also the user will be able to turn on GPS this way the algorithm can determine where the pictures are being taken and how often and long the user is there. The user will go through a step-by-step installation of simply commanding the glass to take pictures at intervals to track where the pictures are taken also to simply add videos when needed and then the data will be housed in the app that can also be put on a stand-alone desktop or laptop. 

The key to the data acquisition portion of the app is for the algorithm to scan through and differentiate the same pictures, also the data needs to be stored in a fashion that is important to the reason the app is being chosen 
for example a pregnancy app we would have a daily folder which would also have a time lapse function to separate and merge pictures for the user
 
The most ideal comparable life logging app would be the saga LifeLog app a robust and fluid application that automatically tracks off the smartphone everything the user does on the phone
saga tracks pictures taken, GPS, how long you stay at locations (GPS) what Internet traffic you use, text messages etc. everything the phone does the app stores and maintains.
